There are two basic application I am currently working: paoloexample.c and paoloexample_b.c

paoloexample.c is an example of COO matrix with a single element, with parallel or not sorting and AB
paoloexample_b.c is an example of COO matrix with BN x BM blocks (2x2 4x4 8x8), with parallel or not sorting and AB
